This is just another React UI Framework.
It's aimed to provide the cleanest and most minimalistic look possible.

The components currently require you to manually include the scss files.
We might change to a different way of handling css, like [react-with-styles](https://github.com/airbnb/react-with-styles) in the future.

**Fair warning**: Currently under heavy development, so everything might break anytime, even tho I try to make changes as incremental as possible.
